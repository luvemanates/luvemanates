Hi 👋 My name is Matthew Carr
=============================

I am Designing and Engineering Software, producing music, and authoring 13 books.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm an orphan, but I find love in doing the work that I do. I've been a software engineer for over 20 years, and I've been making music since I was a kid. More recently I've taken to writing books, screenplays, and short stories.
